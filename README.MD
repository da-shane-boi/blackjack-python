# BLACKJACK
The game includes 1- 4 players excluding the dealer
Each player a certain amount of chips (you can decide whether its a fixed amount every time or an amount decided by the players)
rules of blackjack:
- before cards are dealt each player selects their betting amount
- ace counts as either 1 or 11
- jack, queen and king king counts as 10
- each player is dealt 2 cards face up
- the dealer is dealt 2 cards with the first card faced down
- each player is playing against the dealer only
- each player can quit the game during their by entering the quit command
- you must include the options to hit, stay or split
    - hit - draw a new card
	- stay - ends your turn
	- split - if you dealt a pair as your first two cards, you can split them into separate hands. It's like doubling your chances of winning. However, you must also double your original bet.
	
## dealers rules:
- only the first card must be shown when the players make their turns
- ace must count as 11
- if the 2 cards the dealer has is equal to 17 or more the dealer must stay
- else the dealer draws 1
- whenever the dealer beats a player it displays a random insult towards that player
